PROJECTS: IEEE-754 Floating Point Unit (FPU) Design and Integration on FPGA: 
1) Designed and implemented a 32-bit IEEE-754 compliant Floating Point Unit (FPU) in Verilog, supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
2) Verified functionality via ModelSim using a custom testbench. 
3) Packaged the FPU as an Avalon-MM IP core and integrated it into a SoC system with a NIOS II processor. 
4) Synthesized and deployed the design on an Altera DE2 FPGA board using Intel Quartus Prime.
